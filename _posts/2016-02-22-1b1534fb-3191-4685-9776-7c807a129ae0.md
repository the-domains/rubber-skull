**Rubber Skull Art by Larry Larsen**

An original interpretation of rubber skull by the late Larry Larsen. Pencil and Ink on paper 1997.This was completed after the album came out and was used as the promo poster. Larry was an incredible artist with a pencil. This was done out of the kindness of his heart and his son's request. Matt Larsen was always a huge supporter of the band. He hired us to play what became know as "Fiasco '96", a giant party in his garage that November. They had space heaters, a tent and let us paint a F.O.K logo on the backdrop they put up in the garage where we were to play. It remains one of my favorite gigs ever. We had just finished recording Rubber Skull but it wasn't out yet. The whole band was on fire! Those songs rarely sounded that savage. The gig went great...but I knew it would. Something was in the air. This was one of those very rare moments in life where you just know. I knew these songs and this album were good, people were going to like them, remember them and we had finally arrived as our own band.
