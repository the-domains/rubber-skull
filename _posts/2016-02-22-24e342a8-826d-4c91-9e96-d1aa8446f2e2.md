**The Piano on the Hill...**

I first heard about this local landmark when I was a boy. You could only see it at certain times of the year, fall and winter mostly when the leaves were gone and weeds were dead. Still, I always tried to catch a glimpse when passing on the highway below. I learned later on that it was originally an advertisement for a local orchestra and later still a local music store. We originally used a photo of the piano taken by Mike Ferarri in the CD tray. Since I didn't have a copy of his photo for the reissue I finally climbed the hill several years ago to get some pictures of my own. I heard there is barely anything left to it today.
