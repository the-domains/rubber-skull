**The Piano on the Hill:** I first heard about the piano on the hill when I was a boy. You could only see it at certain times of the year, fall and winter mostly when the leaves were gone and weeds were dead. Still, I always tried to catch a glimpse when passing on the highway below. I learned later on that it was originally an advertisement for a local orchestra and later a local music store. Several years ago I finally climbed the hill to get some pictures. I heard there is barely anything left to it today.
