**The Giant Restored & Rubber What?**

On the original printings of Rubber Skull the photo came out extremely dark and it was difficult to see any detail. Our good friend Brandan Pierard made us a huge fold out booklet for free and he saved us hundreds of dollars. This is the cover photo re-scanned without filters. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/93909061-c82f-4708-a5a5-3cd97cf2fb9f.jpg)

Honestly, I was completely unaware, at least consciously, of the Beatles album Rubber Soul at the time I came up with the title. I remember we used to say someone was a "rubber head" when they did something dumb. The covers even look similar with the trees in the background and logo in upper left. Subconscious theft on my part? Maybe.
