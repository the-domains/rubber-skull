**The Giant Restored & Rubber What?**
![The original cover photo](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bfba2fe8fbb462c6a69db0133db65abb66dd5cbd.jpg)

On the original printings of Rubber Skull the photo came out extremely dark and it was difficult to see any detail. Our good friend Brandan Pierard made us a huge fold out booklet for free and he saved us hundreds of dollars. This is the cover photo re-scanned without filters. 

Honestly, I was completely unaware, at least consciously, of the Beatles album Rubber Soul at the time I came up with the title. I remember we used to say someone was a "rubber head" when they did something dumb. The covers even look similar with the trees in the background and logo in upper left. Subconscious theft on my part? Maybe.
