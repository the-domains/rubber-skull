**I'm Not Too Clear On The Lyrics...**.  ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/806f363f9b1ceb7380be9f6d0a9b27a4179cea7e.jpg)

My comp book containing all the final lyrics for Rubber Skull. This book also shows some of the alternate title ideas we were kicking around before we (wisely) chose Rubber Skull. The original title was "Yor Evel" Roy Leve spelled backwards. This was by no means an insult to Mr. Leve. I was great friends with his son and they were always very kind to me. It was simply a funny title.
